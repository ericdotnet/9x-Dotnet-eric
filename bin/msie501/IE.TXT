Installing Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 and Internet Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether you choose to install over the network or download the 
installation files to your hard disk, some or all of the Setup 
files are copied to your hard disk. This allows you to reinstall 
more quickly if necessary. If you want to reclaim the disk space, 
you can remove the Setup directory by double-clicking the 
Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel and then clicking 
Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2. In the Microsoft Internet Explorer Setup 
dialog box, click the Advanced button, and then click "Remove the 
folder containing Internet Explorer setup files."

You cannot install Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 to or run it from a 
network drive. However, you can download it to a network drive. 
To do this, you must map the network drive to a drive letter on 
your computer. You cannot download Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 to a

Running Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0

NOTE: You must have administrative privileges to install 
      and uninstall this program on Windows NT. This includes 
      having administrative privileges the first time you 
      start your computer after installing or uninstalling.

You must restart your computer after installing Internet

Internet Files folder (cache). The user must have write 
permission so that files can be stored in the Temporary 
Internet Files folder.

If you must reinstall Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3)

when prompted that you do not want it to overwrite any files 
that are newer. After SP3 is reinstalled, carry out the 
following steps to update the registry:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.
2. Type the following: regsvr32 rsabase.dll

Installing Windows NT 4.0 Service Packs 
Over Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2
------------------------------------------
If you reinstall a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack after Internet 
Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 is installed on your computer, some components 
will need to be re-registered. To do this, carry out the 
following steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.
2. Click the Install/Uninstall tab.
3. Click Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 and Internet Tools,

Installing Over Windows 2000 Releases
-------------------------------------
Typical and Full installs are not currently available for Windows 2000. 
Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 will install a minimal set of files 
into your system, this includes updated web browser, mail components and
scripting support.

Uninstall Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 before upgrading to Windows 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows 2000 contains an earlier version of Internet Explorer components
When upgrading from Windows 9x or NT to Windows 2000, we recommend that 
you uninstall Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 before the upgrade. 

Installing Internet Explorer 5.5 over 5.01 Service Pack 2 in Windows 2000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
After installing Internet Explorer 5.5 on Windows 2000. When you uninstall
Internet Explorer 5.5 and go back to Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2,
uninstall of Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 will no longer be available. 

Running Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 on a Dual-Boot Operating System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 on a computer that is
set up to dual boot between two operating systems on the same 
partition (for example, Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0), and you 
have configured the computer to share a single Program Files 
folder, you may have problems with add-on components. Also, when 
you uninstall an add-on component from either copy of Internet 
Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2, it will be removed from both of them without 
updating the other operating system's installed components 
information. These problems are because the add-on files are 
all stored in the shared Program Files folder, but information 
about installed add-on components is stored elsewhere.

Installing or Upgrading the Windows Desktop Update
--------------------------------------------------
To install or upgrade the Windows Desktop Update, you must 
install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2 before you install 
Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2. 

If you have already installed Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 and would 
like to install the Windows Desktop Update, carry out the 
following steps:

1. Uninstall Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2.
2. If Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2 is not already installed on 
   your computer, install it.
3. Install the Windows Desktop Update.
4. Reinstall Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2.

Installing Over Localized Windows 98 Arabic and Hebrew Releases
---------------------------------------------------------------
Windows 98 Arabic and Hebrew require the corresponding localized 
version of Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2. It is not possible to install 
the English version of Internet Explorer over the localized 
version of Windows 98. This restriction does not apply to 
localized versions of Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0. You cannot 
install localized Arabic/Hebrew Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 on top of 
localized Windows 95 (only English is supported). 

Installing Outlook Express 5 on Windows Terminal Server
-------------------------------------------------------
Before installing Outlook Express 5 on Windows Terminal 
Server, the administrator needs to set a compatibility flag 
in the registry for the Outlook Express 5 setup program to 
work correctly. To do this, carry out the following steps:

1. Create this registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
   Terminal Server\Compatibility\Applications\setup50

2. Set the following value under the new setup50 key (this value 
   should be of type REG_DWORD): 

   Flags = 0x108

Installing Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 
with Norton Protected Recycle Bin Enabled
-----------------------------------------
It is recommended that you disable the Norton Protected 
Recycle Bin while you install Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2, and 
that you empty the Norton Protected Recycle Bin before you 
run Setup. Before you empty the Norton Protected Recycle 
Bin, be sure you review its contents in case it contains 
any items you want to recover safely. You can re-enable 
this feature after Internet Explorer 5 Setup is complete.

This is recommended because Norton Protected Recycle Bin 
will intercept the removal of temporary files that Setup 
is trying to delete, and you could run out of free space 
on your hard disk if your remaining free space is limited. 
This would cause Internet Explorer Setup to appear locked. 
For instructions on disabling and re-enabling the Norton 
Protected Recycle Bin, see the Norton Utilities documentation.

Installing on Windows 98 with Novell IPX/IP client
--------------------------------------------------
If you are using Novell IPX/IP client with Windows 98, you may 
experience problems if you install Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 from 
the Internet. If Setup appears to become unresponsive, restart 
your computer. Setup will continue and finish normally. To work 
around this problem, try one of the following options:

- From the Internet, select the Download Only option, 
  and then run and install Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 normally.

- Install Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 from a CD-ROM.

Uninstalling Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 and Internet Tools
