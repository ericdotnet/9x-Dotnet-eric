# Binary Files

These are official Microsoft installer files necessary for usage with .NET 2.0 on Windows 95. They are here untampered and provided mostly for convenience and ease when building the repository. Any patches required get applied by the installer on the user's system, not in the repository (except for where otherwise specified, such as in the `msil` directory).
